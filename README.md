# PawPal+ (Module 2 Project)

You are building **PawPal+**, a Streamlit app that helps a pet owner plan care tasks for their pet.

## Scenario

A busy pet owner needs help staying consistent with pet care. They want an assistant that can:

- Track pet care tasks (walks, feeding, meds, enrichment, grooming, etc.)
- Consider constraints (time available, priority, owner preferences)
- Produce a daily plan and explain why it chose that plan

Your job is to design the system first (UML), then implement the logic in Python, then connect it to the Streamlit UI.

## What you will build

Your final app should:

- Let a user enter basic owner + pet info
- Let a user add/edit tasks (duration + priority at minimum)
- Generate a daily schedule/plan based on constraints and priorities
- Display the plan clearly (and ideally explain the reasoning)
- Include tests for the most important scheduling behaviors

## System Classes

PawPal+ is built on four classes defined in `pawpal_system.py`:

- **Owner** — represents the person using the app. Holds a name, a daily time window (`day_start`/`day_end` in minutes-since-midnight), optional preferences, and a list of `Pet`s. Provides `add_pet()`, `all_tasks()` (flat list across all pets), and `total_task_load()`.
- **Pet** — represents a single pet with identifying info (name, species, breed, age, special_needs) and a list of `Task`s. Manages its own task collection via `add_task()`, `remove_task()`, and `tasks_by_priority()`.
- **Task** — represents one care activity. Key attributes: `name`, `duration` (minutes), `priority` (higher = more important), `preferred_time` (minutes-since-midnight, optional), `due_date`, `recurrence` (`"daily"` or `"weekly"`), and `completed`. `mark_complete()` flips the flag and, for recurring tasks, spawns and registers the next occurrence.
- **Schedule** — the planner. Takes an `Owner` and a `date`, then `generate()` builds the daily plan across all pets in four phases: collect due tasks → sort by priority/duration → anchor preferred-time tasks (resolving clashes by priority) → fill remaining gaps. Also provides `sort_by_time()`, `filter_tasks()`, `detect_conflicts()`, and `explain()`.

## Getting started

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Suggested workflow

1. Read the scenario carefully and identify requirements and edge cases.
2. Draft a UML diagram (classes, attributes, methods, relationships).
3. Convert UML into Python class stubs (no logic yet).
4. Implement scheduling logic in small increments.
5. Add tests to verify key behaviors.
6. Connect your logic to the Streamlit UI in `app.py`.
7. Refine UML so it matches what you actually built.

## 🖥️ Streamlit UI Features

The app is launched with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Owner setup
Set the owner name and the day's start/end times (defaults: 07:00–21:00). The schedule respects this window — tasks that don't fit before day-end are dropped.

### Pet & task management
- Add pets with name, species, and optional breed.
- Add tasks with title, duration, priority, category, recurrence, and optional preferred time.
- Remove any task directly from the task list. Removing a task clears the stale schedule so you're prompted to regenerate.

### Schedule view
After clicking **Generate schedule**, the UI shows:

- **Summary metrics** — tasks scheduled, completed count, total time, and % of the day used.
- **Conflict warnings** — if two tasks overlap in the final plan, each conflict appears as a yellow warning above the table so it can't be missed.
- **Rescheduled tasks** — tasks that had a preferred time but were moved by the scheduler appear in an expandable section (distinct from unresolved conflicts).
- **Interactive schedule table** — sorted by start time, with columns for Time, Pet, Task, Duration, Priority, and Category. Each row has a checkbox to mark the task complete; checking it strikes through the task name and updates the metrics immediately.
- **Category filter** — narrow the schedule view to a single category (walk, feeding, meds, grooming).
- **Dropped tasks** — tasks that couldn't fit in the day window are listed in a bordered warning block.
- **Why this plan?** — an expandable section that explains the scheduling decisions: how tasks were prioritized, which kept their preferred time, which were moved and why, and which were dropped.

### "Why this plan?" example output

```
How today's plan was built (2026-07-03):

1. Prioritization: tasks were sorted by priority (high → low), then by
duration (shortest first) so more tasks fit when time is tight.

2. Placement: 3 task(s) kept their preferred time (anchored), 0 task(s)
had no preferred time and were fitted into open gaps.

3. Rescheduled (1 task(s) couldn't keep their preferred time):
   - Midori's 'Morning walk': requested 09:45, placed at 07:00
     (preferred slot was taken by a higher- or equal-priority task).

4. All tasks fit — nothing was dropped.
```

## 🧪 Testing PawPal+

```bash
# Run the full test suite:
python -m pytest tests/test_pawpal.py -v

# Run with coverage:
python -m pytest --cov
```

### What the tests cover

| Area | Tests |
|------|-------|
| **Task lifecycle** | Marking a task complete flips `completed`; non-recurring tasks return `None` |
| **Recurrence logic** | `daily` spawns next task +1 day; `weekly` +7 days; unknown recurrence (e.g. `"monthly"`) does not spawn; missing `due_date` falls back to `date.today()` |
| **Sorting correctness** | `sort_by_time()` returns scheduled tasks in chronological order regardless of insertion order |
| **Conflict detection** | Overlapping entries produce a `WARNING` string; back-to-back entries (end == start) are not flagged; empty schedule returns no warnings |
| **Pet & task wiring** | `add_task` sets the back-reference and grows `pet.tasks`; `is_due_today` respects `due_date` over recurrence type; `remove_task` removes the task and clears its pet reference |
| **explain() rationale** | Output describes prioritization logic; anchored vs unanchored counts are accurate; moved tasks show original requested time; dropped tasks are named with reason; "all fit" and "no moves" messages appear when appropriate |
| **Pet reference healing** | A task added directly to `pet.tasks` (bypassing `add_task`) has its `pet` reference re-attached during `generate()` without crashing |
| **Owner day window** | Defaults to 07:00–21:00; unanchored tasks start at `day_start`; tasks that can't fit before `day_end` are dropped |
| **filter_tasks** | Filter by pet name; filter by completion status; combined pet + completed filter; no-match returns empty list |

### Confidence Level: ★★★★★ (5/5)

All core behaviors are exercised — task lifecycle, recurrence, sort ordering, conflict detection, scheduling pipeline internals (day window enforcement, task drop when no gap fits, preferred-time clash resolution), `explain()` rationale content, `filter_tasks` combinations, and the pet back-reference healing fix.

## ✨ Features

### Scheduling Algorithm

`Schedule.generate()` builds the daily plan in four phases:

1. **Collect** — gathers every task due today across all pets (`_collect_tasks`). Tasks added directly to a pet without going through `add_task` have their pet back-reference healed automatically here.

2. **Sort** — orders the candidate pool by **priority descending, then duration ascending** (`_sort_tasks`). Higher-priority tasks are placed first; among tasks of equal priority, shorter ones are scheduled first so more tasks fit within the day window.

3. **Anchor preferred times** (`_place_anchored`) — tasks with a `preferred_time` are placed at their requested slot when possible. If a slot is already taken, `_resolve_clash` picks the winner by priority → shorter duration → insertion order; the loser is returned to a "bumped" list and treated as an unanchored task for step 4.

4. **Fill gaps** (`_fill_gaps`) — unanchored and bumped tasks are inserted into the first available gap (≥ task duration) found by scanning forward from `day_start`. Tasks that cannot fit before `day_end` are moved to `Schedule.dropped`.

### Supporting Capabilities

| Capability | Where |
|---|---|
| **Conflict detection** | `Schedule.detect_conflicts()` — O(n log n + k) scan; returns one warning string per overlap |
| **Time-sorted view** | `Schedule.sort_by_time()` — reads `entries` after `generate()`, orders by start time |
| **Task filtering** | `Schedule.filter_tasks(completed, pet_name)` — combinable filters; returns empty list on no match |
| **Recurring tasks** | `Task.mark_complete()` — spawns a next-occurrence `Task` (+1 day for `daily`, +7 for `weekly`) and registers it with the same pet |
| **Scheduling rationale** | `Schedule.explain()` — prose description of prioritization, anchored vs gap-filled counts, moved tasks with before/after times, and dropped tasks |

## 📐 Smarter Scheduling

| Feature | Method(s) | Description |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Time-ordered view** | `Schedule.sort_by_time()` | Returns all scheduled tasks sorted by assigned start time ascending. Useful for displaying the plan chronologically after `generate()` packs tasks by priority. |
| **Task filtering** | `Schedule.filter_tasks(completed, pet_name)` | Filters scheduled tasks by completion status, pet name, or both combined. Passing `completed=False` shows what still needs doing; `pet_name="Biscuit"` narrows results to one pet's tasks. |
| **Conflict detection** | `Schedule.detect_conflicts()` | Scans all scheduled entries for overlapping time windows and returns a list of human-readable warning strings — one per conflict — without raising. Labels each conflict as same-pet or different-pets. |
| **Recurring tasks** | `Task.mark_complete()` | Marking a recurring task complete (`recurrence="daily"` or `"weekly"`) automatically creates and registers the next occurrence with its pet, advancing `due_date` by 1 or 7 days. |

### Conflict detection example

Two tasks are forced to overlap (Biscuit's 60-min vet visit at 10:00 and Mochi's 45-min grooming at 10:20) to demonstrate the warning output:

```
Conflict Detection:
----------------------------------------
  WARNING: Conflict (different pets) — 'Vet checkup' for Biscuit @ 10:00 overlaps 'Grooming session' for Mochi @ 10:20
```

## 📸 Demo Walkthrough

### UI Features at a Glance

| Section | What a user can do |
|---|---|
| **Owner** | Set owner name and the day's start/end times (default 07:00–21:00) |
| **Pets** | Add pets (name, species, breed); view a summary table of all pets and their task counts |
| **Tasks** | Add tasks per pet (title, duration, priority, category, recurrence, optional preferred time); remove any task from the list |
| **Schedule** | Click **Generate schedule** to build the day's plan; re-generate at any time |
| **Schedule table** | Sorted by start time; check a task done to strike it through and update metrics immediately |
| **Category filter** | Narrow the table to walk / feeding / meds / grooming |
| **Conflict warnings** | Yellow banners appear above the table whenever two tasks overlap |
| **Rescheduled tasks** | Expandable section listing tasks that had a preferred time but were moved by the scheduler |
| **Dropped tasks** | Bordered warning block listing tasks that couldn't fit before day-end |
| **Why this plan?** | Expandable rationale: how tasks were prioritized, which kept their preferred time, which were moved and why, which were dropped |

### Example Workflow

1. **Set owner info** — change the owner name to your own and adjust the day window if needed.
2. **Add pets** — enter a pet name (e.g., *Biscuit*), pick *dog* as the species, and click **Add pet**. Repeat for a second pet (*Mochi*, cat).
3. **Add tasks** — for Biscuit, add a *Morning walk* (30 min, high priority, preferred time 08:00) and *Flea meds* (5 min, high priority, no preferred time). For Mochi, add *Morning feeding* (5 min, high priority, preferred time 07:30) and *Playtime* (20 min, low priority).
4. **Generate schedule** — click **Generate schedule**. The scheduler anchors Morning feeding at 07:30 and Morning walk at 08:00, places Flea meds in the first free gap (07:00), and fills Playtime into the next open slot.
5. **Review metrics** — the summary row shows tasks scheduled, completed count, total time, and % of the day used.
6. **Mark tasks done** — check the checkbox next to *Morning walk*; the row strikes through and the completed count updates immediately.
7. **Filter by category** — select *walk* in the category dropdown to see only walk tasks.
8. **Inspect the rationale** — open **Why this plan?** to read exactly how the scheduler prioritized and placed each task.

### Key Scheduler Behaviors Shown

- **Priority + duration sort**: Flea meds (priority 5, 5 min) is scheduled before Morning walk (priority 3, 30 min) even though the walk has a preferred time anchor.
- **Preferred-time anchoring**: Morning feeding lands at 07:30 and Morning walk at 08:00 exactly as requested.
- **Conflict warning**: If two tasks are forced to overlap (e.g., a 60-min vet visit at 10:00 and a 45-min grooming at 10:20), a yellow warning banner identifies both tasks, their pets, and start times.
- **Gap-fill**: Unanchored tasks like Flea meds and Playtime are slotted into the earliest available opening after `day_start`.
- **Drop on overflow**: Tasks that cannot fit before `day_end` appear in the dropped-tasks warning block and are explained in the rationale.
